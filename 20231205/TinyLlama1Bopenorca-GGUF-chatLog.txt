[['hi there', ': Sure, I can help with that. Here\'s an example of how to use the "if" statement in Python:\n\n```python\n# Write a program that checks if the input is a number or not\ndef check_input(number):\n    if type(number) == int:\n        return True\n    else:\n        print("Please enter a number only.")\n        exit()\n\nif check_input(1234567890):\n    # Do something with the input\n```\n\nIn this example, we are checking if the given input is either a number or not. If it\'s a number, we will return True, otherwise, we will print "Please enter a number only." and exit().']]
